# Urban Design and Green Spaces in Peripheral Latin American Neighborhoods
Introduction

This repository focuses on contemporary urban design and its relationship with urban green spaces (UGS) and natural outdoor environments in peripherical Latin American neighborhoods.

Motivation

The aim of this project is to analyze and assess the existing physical conditions of UGS and public spaces in two specific low-income and peripheral neighborhoods in Quito, Ecuador: Toctiuco and La Bota. We seek to understand the potential impact of urban design and green spaces on the overall well-being and health of inhabitants in these regions.

Methodology

To achieve our objectives, we have developed a comprehensive methodology that includes geospatial and network analysis techniques. We have utilized data from various open-source platforms, Google Places API, and Microsoft Planetary Computer, alongside spatial clustering modeling. Our spatial analysis considers variables related to Points of Interest (POIs), roads, and UGS in the mentioned neighborhoods.

Data Collection and Analysis

We collected data focusing on parameters relevant to healthy cities in Latin American low-income and peripheral neighborhoods. The collected data was used to perform quantitative spatial analysis and assess the spatial characteristics of UGS and public spaces in Toctiuco and La Bota.

Structure of the Repository

The repository is structured as follows:

    Case Studies Introduction: Provides an overview of the selected neighborhoods, Toctiuco and La Bota, as case studies.Here you can find the shapefiles.
    Methodology: Explains the process of spatial data collection, geospatial layer information, and references to relevant studies.
    Data Analysis: Identifies, collects, and analyzes data on spatial amenities and characteristics of the case studies using various open-source platforms.
    Key Findings: Presents the results of data analysis related to UGS and public spaces, with reference to healthy cities and the resulting values.
    Conclusion: Summarizes the methodological approach of spatial data collection in Quito's low-income and peripheral neighborhoods, along with directions for future urban design studies.

Future Directions

This research provides valuable insights into the current state of UGS and public spaces in Latin American neighborhoods. Moving forward, we hope to expand our study to encompass more neighborhoods and cities in the region. Our findings can guide policymakers and urban designers in developing effective strategies for creating healthier and more sustainable urban environments.
